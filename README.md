# the lott simulation
Written in Python3 and this is only for fun.
## Games
Time estimation based on **50! games per week** and an average of 100 simulations. You may never win or win div 1 price. Everything is possible but it is unlikely.
#### Oz Lotto
- Div 1 is a dream (UNKNOWN - no win for more than 80,000,000 games)
- Div 2 is also a dream (from 100 years to 1000+ years)
- Div 3 takes about 64 years (possible)
- Div 4 takes about 10 years
- Div 5 takes about 1 years
- Div 6 takes about 0.05 years (2.5 weeks)
- Div 7 takes about 0.03 years (1.5 weeks)
- I actually won $15 (Div 7)
#### Saturday and Monday & Wednesday Lotto
- Div 1 is still a dream but it is much better than Oz Lotto (680 years).
- Div 2 is actually possible within your lifespan (40 years)
- Div 3 takes about 4 years 
- Div 4 takes around 0.11 years (5.7 days)
- Div 5 takes around 0.05 years (2.5 weeks)
- Div 6 takes around 0.04 years (2 weeks)

## Conclusion
- For Oz Lotto, you can occasionally win 15 to 25 dollars, $50 is rare and it is unlikely to win Div 4 onwards.
- For Saturday and Monday & Wednesday Lotto, you can occasionally win 10 to 40 dollars, 1k is super rare and it is unlikely to win Div 2 onwards.

Lucky Lotteries may be better (the cat one).
