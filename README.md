# the lott simulation
Written in Python3 and this is only for fun.
## Games
Time estimation based on **50! games per week** and an average of 100 simulations. You may never win or win div 1 price. Everything is possible but it is unlikely.
#### Powerball (Very Hard)
#### Set for Life (Hard)
- Div 1 might be even worse than Oz Lotto Div 1 (one more number)
- Div 2 is worse than Saturday and Monday & Wednesday Lotto Div 1 (Oz Lotto level)
- Div 3 takes around 92 years
- Div 4 takes around 8.2 years
- Div 5 takes around 0.82 years (43 weeks)
- Div 6 takes around 0.2 years (10 weeks)
- Div 7 takes around 0.03 years (1.6 weeks)
- Div 8 takes around 0.01 years (1 weeks)
- I got a bonus ticket (that's like winning $8.4)
#### Oz Lotto (Medium)
- Div 1 is a dream (UNKNOWN - no win for more than 80,000,000 games)
- Div 2 is also a dream (from 100 years to 1000+ years)
- Div 3 takes about 64 years (possible)
- Div 4 takes about 10 years
- Div 5 takes about 1 years
- Div 6 takes about 0.05 years (2.5 weeks)
- Div 7 takes about 0.03 years (1.5 weeks)
- I actually won $15 (Div 7)
#### Saturday and Monday & Wednesday Lotto (Easy+)
- Div 1 is still a dream but it is much better than Oz Lotto (680 years).
- Div 2 is actually possible within your lifespan (40 years)
- Div 3 takes about 4 years 
- Div 4 takes around 0.11 years (5.7 weeks)
- Div 5 takes around 0.05 years (2.5 weeks)
- Div 6 takes around 0.04 years (2 weeks)
#### Lotto Strike (Easy)
4 numbers in exact order. Strike 2 and 1 are really possible to win.
#### Lucky Lotteries (Very Easy)
Only 270,000 numbers in total. It has the second highest change to win (lower than Lotto Strike - Strike one).

## Conclusion
- For Oz Lotto, you can occasionally win 15 to 25 dollars, $50 is rare and it is unlikely to win Div 4 onwards.
- For Saturday and Monday & Wednesday Lotto, you can occasionally win 10 to 40 dollars, 1k is super rare and it is unlikely to win Div 2 onwards.
- For Set for Life, you can occasionally win 10 to 20 dollars (easier than Saturday and Monday & Wednesday Lotto), $35 is rare and it is unlikely to win Div 4 onwards.
- For Lotto Strike, you can win 1 dollar and occasionally win 100 dollars, $1k is super rare and unlikely to win Div 1.

Lucky Lotteries is recommended. 1 in 270,000 is actually possible.
